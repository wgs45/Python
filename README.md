## Setup and Installation

To run the Python programs in this repository, you need to have Python installed on your system. We recommend using the latest version of Python, which can be downloaded from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/).

### Installation Steps

1. **Python Installation:**
   - Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
   - Ensure `python` and `pip` are added to your system PATH.

2. **Using a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
   - Create a virtual environment:
     ```sh
     python -m venv myenv
     ```
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     - On Windows:
       ```sh
       myenv\Scripts\activate
       ```
     - On Mac/Linux:
       ```sh
       source myenv/bin/activate
       ```

3. **Installing Dependencies:**
   - Install the necessary dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file:
     ```sh
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

## Usage

To run a Python script, navigate to the directory containing the `.py` file and use the following command:

```sh
python filename.py
```

For example:

```sh
python hello_world.py
```
